The output you provided indicates that the program is working correctly. Let's break down the output:

Student Details:

yaml
Copy code
Student Details: John Doe, ID: 1001, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
This line indicates the details of the first student, "John Doe," including the student's name, ID, major, and GPA.

Professor Details:

yaml
Copy code
Professor Details: Dr. Smith, Employee ID: 2001, Department: Mathematics, Salary: 80000.0
This line indicates the details of the professor, "Dr. Smith," including the professor's name, employee ID, department, and salary.

Enrolled students in Java Programming:

yaml
Copy code
Enrolled students in Java Programming:
John Doe
Jane Smith
This part of the output indicates the list of students enrolled in the "Java Programming" course. In this case, both "John Doe" and "Jane Smith" are enrolled.

The output you provided aligns with the expected behavior of the program. It shows that students and professors are correctly instantiated, enrolled in courses, and their details are displayed. If you have any specific questions or if there's anything you would like to modify or add to the program, feel free to let me know!
